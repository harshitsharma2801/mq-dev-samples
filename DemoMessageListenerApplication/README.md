# Message Listener Application

This is an example of a basic message listener application. There is a command line interface for the user to start/stop the listener and send messages.

It was discussed in [this tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/learn-mq/mq-tutorials/slow-lost-messages-high-cpu-improve-your-mq-app/).

In order to run this application, you need to have a connection to a running queue manager. If you need help setting this up, [look here](https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/learn-mq/mq-tutorials/mq-connect-to-queue-manager/).
